Heuristic takes in:
1. Match data: Will be a vector of size 25 indicating whether the students answers matched on that question. 
2. Correctness data: Will be 2 vectors of size 25 each indicating whether the students got that question correct. 
3. Time data vectors: 1 Vectors of size 25 each indicating the absolute difference in the times that the student submitted that question. 

All vectors will have None's in places where the student did not take that test.
